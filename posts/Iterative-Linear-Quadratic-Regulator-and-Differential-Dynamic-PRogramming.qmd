Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is an indirect method which optimizes over the unconstrained control-space. It uses a 2nd-order Taylor series approximation of the cost-to-go in Dynamic Programming (DP) to compute Newton steps on the control trajectory.

* iLQR:  Only keeps the first-order terms (Gauss-Newton approximation), which is similar to Riccati iterations, but accounts for the regularization and line-search required to handle the nonlinearity.
* DDP: Second-order terms included (Newton approximation).

The iLQR/DDP controller solves the following finite-horizon optimization (Non-linear trajectory optimization) problem:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\min_{x_{1:N},u_{1:N-1}} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \bigg[ \frac{1}{2} (x_i - {x}_{ref})^TQ({x}_i - {x}_{ref}) + \frac{1}{2} u_i^TRu_i \bigg] + \frac{1}{2}(x_N- {x}_{ref})^TQ_f
({x}_N- {x}_{ref})\\
\text{st} \quad 
& x_1 = x_{\text{IC}} \\
& x_{i+1} = f(x_i, u_i)  \quad \text{for } i = 1,2,\ldots,N-1  
\end{aligned}
$$
